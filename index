Tree-Basics
===================

This directory will contain some basic implementation of trees,
their advantages, usages, time complexity.

==================

1. BST:

About: You can view it as an dynamic sorted array. It is a binary tree with the assumption
that anything less than parent goes to the left side and anything greater than the
parent goes to the right side. Insertion is easier while deletion is bit tricky. we
will implement basic BST, insertion, deletion, searches, pred, successor, etc.
